## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup

### What I learned

In this tutorial, I built my first web page with HTML5 markup.  I learned about the boilerplate tags needed in every HTML document.  I enjoyed nesting the tags to keep things organized.  I also found it interesting that `<title>` goes in the `<head>` and appears in the tab while `<h1>` can be used as the title on the webpage.

I was familiar with the levels of headings because of Word, so that part was easy.  I also appreciated the semantic meaning behind `<strong>` and `<em>` versus `<b>` and `<i>`.  Lists I had learned before when dabbling in coding a few years back.

One of the biggest aha! moments this time around was grasping that HTML is for structure and CSS is for presentation.  I like the approach to begin typing out the content/structure before diving into all the fancy formatting work.

New code snippets include:

```html
<!-- Comment -->
```

```html
<br>
```

```html
<hr>
```

### Continued development

The newest elements for me were `<br>` and `<hr>`.  While I feel comfortable with the other elements, I would like more practice with these two to help lock them in my memory.

Though it wasn't the focus of this tutorial, I would also like to continue to study markdown.  I'm sure future README.md files will cover other topics such as tables, videos, and footnotes.
